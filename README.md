# HighCloud AI Landing Page

Single-file, high-performance, accessible landing page for practical AI training & services aimed at non‑coders.

## Tech Stack
- Pure HTML5 (single `index.html`)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN (no build step)
- Inline CSS utilities (glass, gradients, motion safety)
- Vanilla JS (navigation, FAQ, form validation, toasts, help panel)

## Local Usage
Just open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build or tooling required.

## Deployment
This repo is intended for GitHub Pages hosting.
1. Commit `index.html`
2. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root
3. Wait for build, then visit: https://xthreo.github.io/highcloud-ai

## TODO
- Add `og-image.png`
